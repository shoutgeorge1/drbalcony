Subject: Ready-to-Use Email Campaign Links

Hi Seza,

I've created two professional government-style violation notice pages that are perfect for your email campaigns. These look like official government compliance alerts and include interactive exemption quizzes.

**READY-TO-USE LINKS:**

SB-721 Violation Notice (Apartment Buildings):
https://drbalcony.vercel.app/components/email-sections/sb721-violation-notice.html

SB-327 Violation Notice (Single-Family Homes):
https://drbalcony.vercel.app/components/email-sections/sb327-violation-notice.html

**HOW TO USE IN MAILCHIMP:**

1. Create a new campaign in MailChimp
2. Choose your audience (apartment owners vs. single-family homeowners)
3. Use the appropriate URL as your main link
4. Write a compelling subject line like:
   - "URGENT: SB-721 Compliance Notice - Action Required"
   - "Building Safety Violation Notice - January 1, 2026 Deadline"
   - "Government Compliance Alert - $50,000+ Penalties"

**WHAT THESE PAGES INCLUDE:**
- Professional government document styling
- Urgent deadline messaging (January 1, 2026)
- Penalty information with specific dollar amounts
- Interactive exemption quiz with scoring
- Contact information for Dr. Balcony
- Mobile-responsive design

**AUDIENCE SEGMENTS:**
- Apartment building owners → Use SB-721 link
- Single-family homeowners → Use SB-327 link
- Mixed audience → Use both links

**TESTING:**
- Visit the links first to see how they look
- Test on your phone to make sure they work
- Send to yourself before sending to your audience

These pages will generate high engagement because they look like official government notices and include interactive features that keep people engaged.

Let me know if you need any changes!

George
