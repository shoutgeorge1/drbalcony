Subject: Services Section Redesign - 8 Value Props Ready for Review

Hi Tolgar,

Per your request, I've completed the services section redesign:

- Swapped out 6 boxes for 8 value propositions
- Integrated all value props from webinar slide
- Added SEO-optimized subtext for each card
- Created two layout variations

Variation 1 (Service-Focused): https://drbalcony-services-section-qdu50kb6s-shoutgeorge1s-projects.vercel.app

Variation 2 (Value Props): https://drbalcony-services-section-a2kvl5g3m-shoutgeorge1s-projects.vercel.app

Both include:
- All 8 webinar slide value props
- SEO-optimized content (SB-326, SB-721, EEE keywords)
- WordPress-ready HTML blocks
- Responsive design
- Internal links to relevant pages

Ready for your review and feedback.

Best,
George
