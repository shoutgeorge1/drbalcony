Subject: Quick Update - Website Mockups Ready for Review

Hey guys,

Here's a quick update on what was done today and what we can work on tomorrow. I'm starting to build these things in Cursor and then deploy to GitHub and Vercel. These are just mockups, so I'm assuming once you guys approve them, I'll have to get the code and then format it for WordPress, which is like another step since WordPress has its own formatting requirements.
