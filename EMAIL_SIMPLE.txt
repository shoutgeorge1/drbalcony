Hey guys,

I know we've been waiting for these sections to be redone. I reworked them a little bit going into some detail.

I updated both the services section and value proposition section with:
- DrBalcony brand colors and Poppins font
- Better mobile responsiveness 
- Larger, more readable text
- Fixed all the links to point to logical pages

Value Proposition Section: https://drbalcony-services-section-evrq1cri2-shoutgeorge1s-projects.vercel.app/value-proposition-section.html

If these are good to go, you can copy and paste the HTML into an HTML block and then delete the old section.

Let me know if you need me to make any changes or if you want me to handle the integration directly.

Thanks
