# Services Section Redesign - Implementation Email

**Subject:** Services Section Redesign - Draft Ready for Review

Hi [Name],

I've completed the modernized services section redesign as requested. Here's what we accomplished:

## What We Did
- Redesigned the "Our Services" section with a modern, clean layout
- Improved visual hierarchy with better icons, titles, and descriptions
- Enhanced user experience with hover effects, gradients, and smooth animations
- Made it fully responsive for all devices (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Added a featured card for "Design Repair Services" to highlight your key offering
- Maintained WordPress compatibility using emoji icons that display reliably

## Current Status
The new design is ready for review at: https://drbalcony.com/?page_id=14644&preview=true

**Important:** This is a duplicate page created for testing purposes.

## Next Steps (Pending Approval)
1. If approved: We'll copy the new code into a fresh block on the homepage
2. Remove the existing services section from the current homepage
3. Test the integration to ensure everything works properly
4. Go live with the new modernized design

The new section maintains all your existing links, GTM tracking, and accessibility features while providing a much more modern and professional appearance.

Let me know if you'd like any adjustments to the design or if you're ready to proceed with the homepage integration.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
