Subject: SB-721 Government-Style Violation Notice - Ready to Use

Hi Seza,

I've created a professional government-style violation notice for SB-326 & SB-721 (apartment buildings) that's perfect for your email campaigns. This looks like an official government compliance alert with penalties, deadlines, and interactive exemption quiz.

**LIVE LINKS:**

**NOTE:** The first link covers both SB-326 (balcony inspections) and SB-721 (multi-family property inspections) for apartment buildings - our main target market. The second link is for SB-327 (single-family homes) if needed.
